            </h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated and detail-oriented Final Year Computer Science Engineering undergraduate currently
                pursuing my
                B.Tech. at <strong>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University</strong>, with a solid academic record
                and a passion for
                software development and full-stack web technologies. My technical expertise spans programming languages
                such as C, Python (including Tkinter and object-oriented programming), and Java, complemented by strong
                skills in front-end development using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I am also proficient in
                database management with MySQL and MongoDB, and familiar with modern development tools and platforms
                including Power BI, AWS S3, Git, GitHub, VSCode, and Django. <br><br>

                Throughout my academic journey, I have built a diverse portfolio of projects that showcase my ability to
                design and implement practical and responsive software solutions. These projects include developing
                interactive web applications such as a personal portfolio website with smooth navigation and animations,
                e-commerce <strong>clones of Myntra and Amazon</strong> demonstrating responsive UI design, and a
                dynamic To-Do List
                application utilizing DOM manipulation. Additionally, I have created a <strong>Python-based Expense
                    Tracker</strong> with
                a MySQL backend for personal finance tracking, and a sophisticated Recommendation System leveraging
                Python libraries and machine learning techniques like XGBoost classifier and content-based filtering to
                simulate real-world applications like Netflix and Spotify. I also developed a <strong>Text-to-HTML
                    Generator </strong>web
                app using Django for backend processing and JavaScript for client-side rendering, highlighting my
                full-stack capabilities. <br><br>

                I have earned multiple certifications that reinforce my technical foundation, including Frontend Web
                Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Introduction to Python by Microsoft, Object-Oriented Programming
                with Python and Java, C Programming from IIT Bombay, Power BI for Excel, and AWS S3 Basics. These
                certifications demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and staying current with evolving
                industry trends. <br><br>

                Beyond technical skills, I bring strong soft skills such as effective communication, teamwork,
                adaptability, and problem-solving. I am passionate about collaborating in dynamic, growth-oriented
                environments where I can contribute meaningfully to impactful tech solutions while honing my abilities.
                My inclusive leadership style and friendly demeanor foster mutual respect and seamless cooperation
                within teams, enabling me to deliver high-quality results.
                <br><br>
                As I seek entry-level opportunities in software development, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills
                to real-world challenges, grow professionally, and contribute to innovative projects that drive
                organizational success.
